This code is an example of how to use the @metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata library to create a new metadata account on the Solana blockchain for a given mint.

The code imports the necessary libraries, including the @metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata, @solana/web3.js, and @project-serum/anchor. It then defines a function loadWalletKey that loads a Solana wallet keypair from a JSON file.

The main function then creates a new metadata account for a given mint. It first loads the keypair using the loadWalletKey function, and then defines the necessary accounts and data for the metadata account. The dataV2 object defines the metadata attributes, including the token name, symbol, URI, and other optional properties.

The mpl.createCreateMetadataAccountV2Instruction function is then used to create an instruction for creating the metadata account, which is added to a new transaction. The transaction is then sent to the Solana blockchain using the web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction function.

To run the code, simply run main() in a Node.js environment and ensure that the necessary libraries are installed.
